## A demonstration of the eigenvalue perturbation approach for Large Eddy Simulations

See Jofre et al. (2017). The files here demonstrate the method using test positive semi-definite matrices. The `DCP.cpp` class demonstrates the perturbations as applied to NaluCFD, and the `bary_map.py` script plots the anisotropy tensor on a barycentric map.
